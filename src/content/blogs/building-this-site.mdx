## Intro & Motivation

I’m on the hunt for a new job and I’ve found, through interviewing hundreds of people over the years, that you need to stand out in a sea of applicants. My personal website will serve as a place to showcase my work, thoughts on various topics, and will include rants on things I’m passionate about.  

So if you’re hiring and my website made me stand out, welcome! I guess it’s working.  

Now back to this guide. I consider myself to be a technical hands-on leader, so when I found out about a cool new tech in **Astro**, I wanted to check it out. My official review on it is that it’s **AWESOME**.  

I was able to get everything in this guide done in less than a day (I obviously already had some know-how). But man, I was impressed with how easy it was to get up and running, and equally impressed with **Cloudflare Pages**. Well done, teams.

## Step-by-Step: How I Built This Site

### 1. Domain
First thing I did was buy a domain from Namecheap. Simple enough.  

### 2. Bootstrapping Astro
I used npm to spin up a new Astro project locally:
```bash
npm create astro@latest personal-site
npm install
npm run dev
```

At that point I was staring at the default starter site.

3. Picking a Theme

I went down the rabbit hole of themes, landed on wasutz/astro-resume-theme, and used Astro’s CLI to download and configure it. This gave me a solid landing/resume page out of the box.

4. Learning the Structure

Astro has a clean file structure:
- src/layouts/ → page shells
- src/pages/ → routes like /, /blog, /links
- src/content/blogs/ → markdown posts
- public/ → static assets like images

Once I understood this, updating content was straightforward.

5. Uploading to GitHub

I initialized a repo and pushed the code up to GitHub. That set me up nicely for continuous deployment.

6. Cloudflare Pages Setup

Logged into my Cloudflare account, created a new Pages project, and linked it to the GitHub repo.
	- Framework preset: Astro
	- Build command: npm run build
	- Output dir: dist

7. Pointing My Domain

I transferred the domain by updating nameservers in Namecheap to Cloudflare’s. From there, adding the custom domain in Pages was smooth—free SSL and instant HTTPS.

8. CI/CD in Action

With GitHub connected, every push to main auto-deployed. PRs gave me preview URLs. That feedback loop made fixing bugs quick.

9. Test Deployments & Fixes

I had a few little things to iron out:
	- Layout import mismatch (Base.astro vs. Layout.astro).
	- RSS schema differences (blogs + datetime instead of blog + pubDate).
	- Converting config files from JSON to TS to avoid parse errors.

After patching those, deploys went green.

10. Final Content

I updated the About section, pruned the example posts (kept them around as drafts), and polished up the blog and links pages. What you’re reading right now is the result.

A Note on Writing Posts
	- Clickable image example:

	- Table of Contents: I wired up a plugin so any ## Contents heading expands into a list of headings below. That’s what you see at the top of this post.

⸻

Lessons Learned
	- Keep examples, but hide them: I just add draft: true to their frontmatter and filter them out in queries.
	- Astro content collections are great, but watch the schema (this theme uses datetime).
	- Cloudflare Pages is honestly underrated—smoothest deploy experience I’ve had in a while.

⸻

Closing Thoughts

In one day I went from “I should really have a personal site” to a polished About page, a blog, and a link hub, all backed by modern tooling and auto-deploys.

Astro made it fun, Cloudflare made it effortless. If you’re on the fence about rolling your own site, my advice: just do it.

And if you’re here because you’re evaluating me for a role—well, I guess the site did its job. 😉
